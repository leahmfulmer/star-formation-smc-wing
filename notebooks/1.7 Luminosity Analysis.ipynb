    "# Luminosity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we analyze stellar luminosity within the SMC Wing for both resolved and unresolved stars. In order to determine the total observed stellar luminosity for our region, we completed an IRAF Apphot analysis surrounding the stellar sample (white contour). We further completed seven circular Apphot analyses for the seven most prominent under-resolved star clusters in the region (red circles). Blue points indicate the stars that were resolved by Daophot among these star clusters. The image on which these analyses were applied was a composite GALEX image, \"ngc602.fits\". The photometered regions are outlined in tetris_clusters_composite.reg. \n",
